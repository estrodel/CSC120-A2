What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Took me a bit to get situated but once I realized I was just dropping the methods into their respective appropriate classes it went pretty quickly. 

My advice would be to remember that this project is more about figuring out which methods go with which classes rather than writing them so keep it simple!
